Tests for exercise 1
=====================
Determine if a string has all unique characters

# Files
* ```1.in```:
  * Each line is a string that will be checked for repeated characters.
* ```1.expected```:
  * The output of your program should be as many lines as strings with 0 or 1 in each line.
  If the string has all unique characters the output is 1. Otherwise is 0.

You should compare your output with 1.expected file:
```
diff <your output> 1.expected
```
